## Introduction

Welcome to my Leet-Code-Solutions repository! This repo showcases my journey in solving DSA problems on LeetCode. Each solution is implemented in C and aims to provide a clear and efficient approach to the problem.

## Solutions

Here are some of the problems I've solved:

- [atoi.c](atoi.c) - Convert a string to an integer.
- [int_to_roman.c](int_to_roman.c) - Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.
- [length_of_last_word.c](length_of_last_word.c) - Find the length of the last word in a string.
- [longest_substring_without_repeating.txt](longest_substring_without_repeating.txt) - Find the longest substring without repeating characters.
- [median_of_two_sorted_arrays.txt](median_of_two_sorted_arrays.txt) - Find the median of two sorted arrays.
- [palindrome.c](palindrome.c) - Check if a string is a palindrome.
- [pow_x_n.c](pow_x_n.c) - Implement the power function.
- [reverse_function.c](reverse_function.c) - Reverse a string.
- [roman_to_integer.c](roman_to_integer.c) - Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
- [sqrt_x.c](sqrt_x.c) - Compute the square root of a number.
- [two_num_sum.c](two_num_sum.c) - Find two numbers that add up to a target sum.
